# RepSmasher

A simple fitness tracker built with React and Vite.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production build / GitHub Pages

The project uses the `gh-pages` branch for deployment. Build and publish with:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command runs the build for you and publishes the contents of `dist/` to the
`gh-pages` branch. Your site will be available at
`https://joshbrodeur.github.io/RepSmasher/`.
